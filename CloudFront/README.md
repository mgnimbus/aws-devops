  * CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3)
* Custom origin (HTTP)
  * Application Load Balancer
  * EC2 instance

CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication
* CloudFront:
  * Global Edge network
  * Files are cached for a TTL (maybe a day)
  * Great for static content that must be available everywhere
* S3 Cross Region Replication:
  * Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
  * Files are updated in near real-time
  * Read only
  * Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions
